    "# 🚀 Intelligent Payment Routing: A Reproducible Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Gemini (Based on user-provided paper specification)\n",
    "**Date:** November 13, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a complete, end-to-end implementation of a machine-learning-based intelligent payment routing system. It follows the pipeline described in the user's paper, including synthetic data simulation, leakage-free stateful feature engineering, stacked model training, time-series-aware evaluation, and XAI."

    "## 📖 Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a smart payment routing solution. The core idea is to predict the probability of success for a given transaction across multiple available payment gateways. By routing the transaction to the gateway with the highest predicted success probability, a merchant can increase their overall success rate, improve customer experience, and reduce costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of:\n",
    "1.  **Data Simulation:** Generating a large-scale (1M transaction) synthetic dataset that mimics real-world payment patterns, including gateway downtimes, peak-hour failures, and bank incompatibilities.\n",
    "2.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating a rich feature set, including critical, leakage-free rolling-window features that capture the real-time state of the payment network (e.g., gateway success rates, latencies).\n",
    "3.  **Model Training:** Developing a stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + XGBoost as base learners, Logistic Regression as meta-learner) trained and validated using time-series-aware cross-validation to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "4.  **Evaluation:** Measuring performance using standard metrics (AUC, Brier Score) and the business-critical **Success@1** metric.\n",
    "5.  **Explainability (XAI):** Using SHAP to understand *why* the model makes its decisions, both globally and for individual transactions.\n",
    "6.  **Adaptive Learning:** Simulating an online feedback loop where the model is periodically retrained on new data to adapt to changing network conditions."

    "### 💡 How to Run This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Environment:** This notebook requires Python 3.8+ and the libraries listed in the `Setup` section.\n",
    "2.  **Installation:** Run the `pip install` cell (Cell 5) to ensure all dependencies are met.\n",
    "3.  **Execution:** You can run the entire notebook end-to-end. Click `Kernel > Restart & Run All`.\n",
    "4.  **Dataset Size:** The variable `N_TRANSACTIONS` is set to `1,000,000` as requested. If you encounter memory (RAM) issues or wish to run a faster test, you can **reduce this to 200,000** in Cell 11. All computations are designed to be as efficient as possible, but 1M rows with rolling feature computations are intensive.\n",
    "5.  **Expected Runtime:** On a standard machine (e.g., 16GB RAM, modern CPU), the full 1M-transaction run may take 30-60 minutes. The most time-consuming steps are Data Simulation, Rolling Feature Engineering, and Model Tuning (GridSearchCV)."

    "The SHAP plots confirmed that our **rolling-window features** (like `gateway_sr_last_5m` and `gateway_latency_avg_10m`) and **key interactions** (like `bank_x_gateway`) were the most important drivers, proving that the model successfully learned the real-time state of the network."

    "\n",
    "While this notebook provides a powerful proof-of-concept, moving to production would require:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Real-Time Feature Store:** The `create_rolling_features` logic would be replaced by a dedicated feature store (like Feast or Tecton) that can compute and serve these stateful features in real-time with low latency.\n",
    "2.  **Model Serving:** The `model_final.pkl` would be deployed as a microservice (e.g., using FastAPI, KFServing) for real-time inference.\n",
    "3.  **CI/CD/CT Pipeline:** The retraining simulation would become a formal MLOps pipeline, automatically triggering retraining on new data, validating model performance, and promoting the new model to production (hot-swapping) if it's better.\n",
    "4.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** The *true* optimization problem is sequential. An even more advanced approach would use RL (e.g., a Multi-Armed Bandit) to actively *explore* gateway options and learn the `(state, action) -> reward` policy directly, rather than just predicting `P(success)`. The `Success@1` backtest we built is the perfect environment to train such an RL agent offline."
